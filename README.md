## Weather App

Web application allowing users to get a weather forecast by the user's current location or by selecting a city. Built with React, Redux, Bootstrap and TypeScript.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development.

## Summary

I decided to develop a weather forecast application mainly to learn Redux and Typescript, but also to improve my React skills.
The app itself was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
